I'm Bryan, a software developer with several years of experience. This blog is an ongoing experiment for me to keep up my skills writing about technical topics.

You can get an idea about my experience from my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a6xupksarlsb8sl/btidwellresumeredacted.pdf?dl=0)

Aside from development I like scifi novels and heavy metal.
