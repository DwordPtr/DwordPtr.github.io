<h2>It's all aboutthe problem domain - what I learned this summer.</h2>
</div>

<p>Computer science majors love to program. We love learning more about our craft and developing skills in new languages or frameworks.
	We love obsessing over the minutia of our chosen favorite language. It can take an aspiring software engineer along time to figure out the industy does not care about these things.</p>
<p>While industry cares about employing skilled passionate developers, it really wants to employ developers with knowledge of the problem domain that the software entials.
	From the first class onward in a CS program, prospective students are conintualy told that computer science is about problem solving. Your job as an engineer is to solve problems for employers. This can be done be producing a deliverable someone will buy (if its free advertisers pay for the user's information), or by reducing costs.
	Thats It. Make money or reduce costs.
	Its important to leave room for the problem one is solving.</p>
<p> A skilled SE in the financial sector can speak in equal detail about big O notation and SOX regulations. A web dev knows javascript like some know their spouse of 10+ years. A SE that doesn't know the in's and outs of the buisness has a significant disadvantage in competeing with the one that does.
More importanly, An SE that doesn't know the buisness cannot hope to convey the value they've created with their skill set.</p>

<p>In engineering we talk about trade-offs to economists and buisness majors these are called oppurtuinty costs (albeit with a more specific definition); get used to seeing the world through the eyes of a buisness major, it wil make your career much easier. </p>
