I'm Bryan, a senior in Computer Science at Austin Peay State University. This blog is an ongoing experiment for me to keep up my skills writing about technical topics.

Aside from development I like scifi novels and heavy metal.

If you're in need of a programmer you can view my [resume] (/assets/resume.pdf) and drop me an email.
